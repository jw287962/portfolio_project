        <h1>About Jason </h1>
        <p>Although I graduated as a Management Information Systems graduate at University of Georgia in 2020, I ended up not pursuing a job in my field.
          I am currently 25 years old, and have discovered a new passion, programming. You can view some of my work here
          while learning through the Odin Project. I am always eager for a challenge, finding enjoyment in problem solving and learning 
          new things. Some of my other hobbies are sports and gaming.

     <h4>Jan 2022 - Before The Odin Project</h4>
     <p>
      I started working at Juicy Seafood, a restaurant, where I was a manager. After working 70-80 Hours a week until September of 2022, 
      I started working around 60 hours a week... Thank God!
      With a little more time to spare, I started playing Valorant and eventually reached Immortal 1. At this point, having reached the top 1%, and 
      feeling like I've been wasting my time with no improvement in my personal life.
      I decided to put my efforts elsewhere. This is when I decided to gradually put more effort into TOP

    <h4>Nov 2022 - The Odin Project</h4>
      <p>
        I truly started engaging with The Odin Project around Nov 2022. Having done multiple projects, I have 
        realized I truly enjoy problem solving and coding. You can view my projects on this website, or on Github It was fun completing these projects despite working 60 hour weeks.
        And I will continue to learn with my spare time
