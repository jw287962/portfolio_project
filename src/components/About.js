        <h1>About Jason </h1>
        <p>Although I graduated as a Management Information Systems graduate at University of Georgia in 2020, I ended up not pursuing a job in my field.
          I am currently 25 years old, and have discovered a new passion, programming. You can view some of my work here
          while learning through the Odin Project. I am always eager for a challenge, finding enjoyment in problem solving and learning 
          new things. Outside of programming, I enjoy hobbies such as playing sports and games.
           </p>
     <h4>Jan 2022 - Before The Odin Project</h4>
     <p>
      I started working at Juicy Seafood, a restaurant, where I was a manager. After working 70-80 Hours a week until September of 2022, 
      I was able to lower that to around 60 hours a week... Thank God!
      With a little more time to spare, I started playing Valorant and eventually reached Immortal 1 in just a few months. At this point, having reached the top 1%, and 
      feeling like I've been wasting my time with no improvement in my personal life, I began looking elsewhere. 
     However, traits such as competitiveness,
      self-drive, and an innate desire for self-improvement have always been following me through these periods.  With that,
      I decided to put my efforts in something new. This is when I decided to really dive into TOP.

    <h4>Nov 2022 - The Odin Project</h4>
      <p>
        I truly started engaging with The Odin Project around Nov 2022. As I solved problem after problem, I soon realized how 
        much fun it is. I have enjoyed making all the different projects, and I am looking to do more in a proffessional setting.
         You can view my projects on this website (with more on Github).
          It was fun completing these projects despite working 60 hour weeks. 
        and I look foward to becoming a full stack developer.
